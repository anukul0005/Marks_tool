Now, I also want to create a statistical data of my entered values in the following way:
The statistical table on this page based on records based data will have these columns:
Chapter --- > "The display of unique chapters as referred from the records table - as per input from user and imported excel.
Total Questions --> "Total questions as counted from all the questions in record table (sorted by chapters)
Attempted --->  Counting of attempted (yes) questions after filtration chapterwise -- from records table
Correct --> Counting of correct (yes) questions after filtration chapterwise -- from records table
Incorrect --> Counting of correct (no) questions after filtration chapterwise -- from records table	Accuracy (%)	--> Percentage of correct no of questions/ attempted no of questions
Score --> Score obtained = 2*Correct question count + (-5)*Incorrect question count
Score Percentage"	-- Score 
Unattempted	"Unattempted
Rate"	"Skipped
Total"	"Skipped
f. Unattempted(%)"	Topic %	Easy	Medium	"Easy
(Correct)"	"Easy
(Skipped)"
